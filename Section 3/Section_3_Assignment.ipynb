        "\n",
        "- Using Hugging Face Transformers, develop an automatically generated MS Word report for your manager on the letters regarding the product. Divide the report into a section on the positive responses and negative responses. Summarize the sentiments towards the product and provide a summary of the letters that reflect the most extreme sentiments. Determine and report in each case on what the customer wants to happen by automatically questioning their respective letters.\n",
        "- Knowing how each customer feels, automatically generate replies to the two most extreme examples, including their name in the greeting in the response.\n",

You can use a Hugging Face text generation pipeline to do this or an online generator like [You.com](https://you.com/search?q=how+to+write+well&&tbm=youwrite&cfr=write&).\n",
        "* You can use the library such as [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) to generate the report and the response letters.\n",
        "* There is a variety of models on Hugging Face for the different tasks, e.g, [question-answering](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=question-answering&sort=downloads) that allow you to try out different models for your task. It is strongly recommended that you review these and look at the model cards in each case. Also, you can test your text in the Hosted inference API on the right hand side of each model."
